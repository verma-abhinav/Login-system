# Login-system
A login is a set of credentials used to authenticate a user.
Most often, these consist of a username and password. However, a login may include other information, such as a PIN number, passcode, or passphrase.
They are a security measure designed to prevent unauthorized access to confidential data.
When a login fails (i.e, the username and password combination does not match a user account), the user is disallowed access. 
Many systems block users from even trying to log in after multiple failed login attempts.
